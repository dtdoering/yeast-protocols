##DAPI nuclear staining

###Materials

###Method
* Harverst 1 ml of yeast culture at 5⋅10<sup>6 </sup>cell/ml;	 	 
* Fix them with 2 ml EtOH 100% for at least 30 minutes;	 
* Wash the cells twice with 2 ml 1X PBS;	 	 
* Resuspend in 1 ml 1X PBS;	 	 
* Cells can be stored at 4°C for a few weeks;	 	 
* Centrifuge the cells and resuspend them in 50 μl of 0.2 μg/ml DAPI(DAPI stock solution 1 mg/ml is 5000X) and leave them 30' in a dark place;
* Wash two times the cells with H<sub>2</sub>O;	 	 
* After the addition of the second wash sonicate the cells 4-5 seconds;	 	 
* Centrifuge 5' at 5000 rpm;	 	 
* Resuspend in 30 μl of 50% glycerol and look ~1µl of cells under the microscope;
