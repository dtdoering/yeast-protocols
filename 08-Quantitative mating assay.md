##Quantitative Mating Assay

###Materials

Strains to be analysed
Tester strain (6122a or 6122alpha, depending on the mating type of the strains to be analysed)
YPD plates
-AA plates
Sterile glass beads for plating

--

###Method
* Inoculate the strains to be analysed and the tester strain in 5 ml YPD and grow ~24 hours to saturation
* Dry the plates very well
* Seed the -AA plates with a lawn of the tester strain
  * Plate 200 µl of the saturated colture
  * Also spread 250 µl of fresh YPD (*this step is required to allow the cells to grow a little giving them the opportunity to mate*)

* Make 1:100 dilutions of the strains to be analysed in water to get down to ~1⋅10 <sup>6</sup> cell/ml
* Further dilute 1:200 in water to obtain ~5⋅10 <sup>3</sup> cell/ml
* Plate 200 µl of the last dilution on the seeded -AA plates (theor. ~1000 cells)
* Plate 25 µl of the last dilution on YPD plates (theor. ~125 cells)

For a wild type strain expect ~200 cells on YPD plates and a little less on -AA plates corresponding to a mating efficiency of about ~10%
