#FACA analysis of yeast samples

* Spin down 1-2 ml of culture at 5*10<sup>6</sup> cell/ml;
* Resuspend the pellet in 1 ml of filtered 70% ethanol @ -20°C;
* Fix  at 4°C at least two hours or overnight;
* Spin down and resuspend in 500 μl of 1 mg/ml RNase A obtained by diluting the 10X stock 1:10 in 50mM Tris-Cl pH 7.5;
* Incubate 2 hours @ 37°C. Overnight is also possible;
* Spin down and resuspend in 500 µl 50mM Tris-Cl pH 7.5 supplemented with 1 mg/ml Proteinase K;
* Incubate 2 hours at 42°C or 1 hour @ 50°C;
* Spin down 3′ @ 4°C and resuspend in 500 μl of FACS Buffer;
* Transfer 100 μl of cell suspension in a FACS tube containing 1ml of either”
* Sytox diluted 1:5000 in 50mM Tris-Cl pH 7.5
* 2 mg/ml Propidium Iodide, diluted 1:1000 in 50mM Tris-Cl pH 7.5
* Sonicate each sample 4 seconds and analyse.
