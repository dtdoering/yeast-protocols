#Yeast protein extracts in TCA

## Materials

## Method:
  *Start from 10 ml of an exponentially growing culture at a concentration of 8*106 cell/ml
  *Spin down the cells 2 minutes @ 4000 rpm in 50 ml tubes
  *Resuspend the pellets in 1 ml of 20% TCA (Trichloroacetic Acid)
  *Transfer in 2 ml tubes
  *Wash the pellets with another ml of 20% TCA
  *Spin down at maximum speed for 1′ and discard the supernatant
  *Resuspend in 50 μl of 20%TCA, vortex
  *Add acid-washed glass beads (400-600 μm) using a measuring spoon
  *Vortex in parallel 4’- 5′
  *Add 100 μl 5% TCA and mix by vortexing
  *Transfer the protein suspension to a new 1.5 ml tube using a p200
  *Centrifuge 10′ at 3000 rpm
  *Discard the supernatant (aspire with a vacuum pump)
  *Add 100 μl of 2X PROTEIN BLUE (diluted from the 6X stock), the solution turns yellow
  *Resuspend the pellet by thorough vortexing
  *Add 50 μl of 2M Tris Base to neutralise the pH. Make sure the solution turns blue
  *Boil 3’ a 95°C
  *Centrifuge at max speed for 2’
  *Transfer the superrnatant to a new 1.5 ml tube
  *Store at -20°C for up to two weeks, -80°C for longer term storage
