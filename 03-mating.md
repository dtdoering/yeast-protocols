##Yeast Mating with diploid Isolation
###Materials

###Method
* In the evening inoculate a small amount of the two strains to be mated in 5ml YPD;
* Incubate static at 30°C overnight;
* Resuspend completely the cells and dilute 1:2000 in sterile water;
* Plate 100 microl on a YPD plate and incubate overnight at 30°C;
* Look for tiny colonies: pick and patch ~10 putative diploids — *diploids colonies are generally bigger: start with the biggest colonies*;
* Check ploidy by FACS and/or sporification assay;
